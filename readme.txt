Convert your entire media library to WebP format instantly. Features a modern UI, bulk actions, and local server-side processing for maximum security.

== Description ==

**Webp Converter Pro** is the ultimate tool for optimizing your WordPress media library. It automatically converts your existing JPEG and PNG images into the modern, high-performance WebP format.

### 🛡️ Your Privacy & Security First
Unlike many other image optimization plugins, **we do NOT send your images to our servers or any third-party APIs.** * **100% Local Processing:** All conversions are performed directly on **your own hosting server**.
* **Data Privacy:** Your images never leave your environment, ensuring your data remains private and secure.
* **No Subscriptions:** Since it uses your server's resources, there are no monthly fees or "credits" to buy.

### 🚀 Key Features
* **Advanced UI:** A clean, modern interface with beautiful animations and a "Glassmorphism" floating action bar.
* **Bulk Conversion:** Select multiple images or your entire library and convert them in one click.
* **Queue System:** Smart processing prevents server timeouts by handling images one by one.
* **Quality Control:** Dedicated settings page with a visual slider to adjust WebP quality.
* **Seamless Replacement:** Replaces original files to ensure your existing site links stay intact.

= Is my data safe? =
Absolutely. The conversion process happens entirely on your hosting server. We do not have access to your images, and they are never uploaded to any external cloud service.
